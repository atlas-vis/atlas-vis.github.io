We start this tutorial by creating a diverging bar chart (Figure 1) using Atlas. This chart visualizes ahypothetical dataset reporting peopleâ€™s opinions on a subject matter, broken down by age (below 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 70, above 70) and responses (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). You can see a demo of this visualization here.

Figure 2 shows the dataset "survey_response.csv" behind this visualization. The data table consists of three columns: Age Group, Response, and Percentage (percentage of people with a particular response within an age group).

### Initialize Scene and Import Data
To begin, we create a [scene](../../group/scene/), which represents a top-level container, and import the data: 

    let scn = atlas.scene(), table = await atlas.csv("survey_response.csv");

Next, let's create a rectangle in the scene and specify its properties: 

    let rect = scn.mark("rectangle", {top: 100, left: 200, 
                        width: 700, height: 30, strokeWidth: 0, fillColor: "#ddd"});

Now we can't see the rectangle yet, as it has not been rendered. If you do `console.log(rect)`, you will be able to see the `rect` object in the console. To display it, let's add a line to create a renderer: 

    atlas.renderer("svg").render(scn, "svgEle");

Here we are creating a renderer that renders the scene to an SVG element with the DOM ID "svgEle". We can see the gray rectangle now:

### Join Graphics with Data and Lay out Marks
Next, we want to have multiple rectangles, each representing an age group. This is done by using the repeat method:
    
    let collection = scene.repeat(rect, table, {field: "Age Group"});

This will give us a collection of four rectangles, each representing an age group in the dataset. By default, the repeated rectangles will have the same properties (including position) as the original rectangle. To space them out, we can apply a grid layout with only 1 column and a vertical gap of 10 pixels between the rows:

    collection.layout = atlas.layout("grid", {numCols: 1, vGap: 10});

This gives us the following visualization: 

{{< figure src="repeat.png" width="350px" alt="Repeat and Lay out Rectangle Marks" caption="" class="border-0 mx-auto text-center" >}}

Next, we want to further break down each age group by responses. We can use the divide method:

    let bars = scn.divide(rect, table, {field: "Response", orientation: "vertical"});

which gives us the following visualization:

{{< figure src="divide.png" width="350px" alt="Divide Rectangle Marks" caption="" class="border-0 mx-auto text-center" >}}

When using the divide method, we don't need to pass all four rectangle marks as its argument; we only need to pass in one rectangle `rect` as an example, and Atlas will find all the "peers" of `rect` and perform divide operation on all of them. The divide method will return a collection of smaller rectangles (`bars`) as a result of dividing `rect`.


### Specify Visual Encodings

Now we can map data fields to visual channels. First let's map "Percentage" to the width of the rectangles. We need to reassign variable `rect` as one of the newly created marks and pass it as an example to the encode method:

    rect = bars.firstChild;
    scn.encode(rect, {field: "Percentage", channel:"width"});

And we can map "Response" to the fill color with a self-defined mapping:

    let colorMapping = {"Strongly agree": "#1e71b8", "Agree": "#7799cf", "Disagree": "#e29d6f",
                        "Strongly disagree": "#da7c43"};
    scn.encode(rect, {field: "Response", channel: "fillColor", mapping: colorMapping});


Here's what we have after applying these encodings:

### Apply Constraints

We want to align these bars so that the blue ones are aligned to the right and the orange ones are aligned to the left. To do so, we find all the light blue bars, which represent the response "Agree", and align them to the right:

    let agreeBars = scn.find([{channel: "fillColor", value: "#7799cf"}]);
    scn.align(agreeBars, "right");

{{< figure src="align.png" width="400px" alt="Encode" caption="" class="border-0 mx-auto text-center" >}}

We can then create some text marks and affix them at the center of the rectangles:

    let text = scn.mark("text", {fillColor: "white"});
    scn.repeat(text, dt);
    scn.encode(text, {field: "Percentage", channel: "text"});
    scn.affix(text, rect, "x");
    scn.affix(text, rect, "y");  

{{< figure src="text.png" width="420px" alt="Encode" caption="" class="border-0 mx-auto text-center" >}}

### Create Axis and Legend

Finally, let's add a legend and an axis (labels only):

    scn.legend("fillColor", "Response", {x: 800, y: 100});
    scn.axis("y", "Age Group", {orientation: "left", x: 190, pathVisible: false, tickVisible: false});

Viola! We have the visualization in Figure 1.
